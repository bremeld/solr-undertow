solr-undertow
=============

[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and SolrCloud running in high performance server - Tiny, fast, easy, standalone deployment without an application server.  Requires JDK 1.7 or newer, Solr 4.1 or newer.  Less than 4MB download, starts instantly, performs inline or better than all application servers.  Written in the [Kotlin language](http://kotlinlang.org) for the JVM (a better Java, not as complex as Scala).

Releases [are available here](https://github.com/bremeld/solr-undertow/releases) on GitHub.

This application launches a Solr WAR file as a standalone server running a high performance HTTP front-end based on [undertow.io](http://undertow.io) (the engine behind WildFly, the new JBoss).  It has no features of an application server, does nothing more than load Solr servlets and also service the Admin UI.  It is production-quality for a stand-alone Solr server.

**NOTE:** Be sure to read the [Tuning Solr-Undertow](./TUNING.MD) guide.

#### Usage

Usage is simple, you only need a configuration file and a Solr WAR:

```sh
bin/solr-undertow <configurationFile>
```

You can run the included example configuration + Solr 4.10.2 (from the release that includes Solr) using:

```sh
bin/solr-undertow example/example.conf
```

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8983/solr`

#### Configuration

The configuration file is on the JSON like [HOCON format](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) and loaded using [TypeSafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config).  So any features it supports are supported here.

A configuration file must minimally contain these settings (paths are relative to the configuration file):

```conf
solr.undertow: {
  solrHome: "./solr-home"
  solrLogs: "./solr-logs"
  tempDir: "./solr-temp"
  solrVersion: "4.10.2"
  solrWarFile: ./solr-wars/solr-${solr.undertow.solrVersion}.war
}
```

In this configuration `solrHome` must contain at minimum `solr.xml` (and `zoo.cfg` if SolrCloud) and any pre-configured cores.

The defaults, and all configuration options can be seen in the [configuration defaults file](src/main/resources/reference.conf).  Which include `httpClusterPort: 8983`, the default server port.

Configured directories are validated at startup to give clear error messages, they are checked for existance and readable/writeable attributes (depending on the directory).

#### Example Configuration / Directory Tree

Two example configurations are provided in the [example directory](example/):

* [Basic configuration](example/example.conf)
* [Configuration with request limitting](example/example-ratelimited.conf) (max concurrent requests + max queued requests)

#### System Properties

Settings from the configuration file will be overriden by system properties of the same fully qualified name (i.e. `solr.undertow.zkHost`) but also by the standard Solr system property used with Jetty (i.e. `zkHost` or `jetty.Port`). The following Solr system properties are recognized, and are also set by solr-undertow so that any Solr configuration file using variable substitution will find them as expected:

|Solr typical|Solr-Undertow Equivalent|
|---|---|
|jetty.port|solr.undertow.httpClusterPort|
|zkRun|solr.undertow.zkRun|
|zkHost|solr.undertow.zkHost|
|solr.log|solr.undertow.solrLogs|
|hostContext|solr.undertow.solrContextPath|
|solr.solr.home|solrHome|
|solr.data.dir|(no equivalent, not checked, passes through to Solr)|

The solr-undertow has priority if both are present in system properties; you only need to provide one and the other will be made to match.

Other Notes
===========


#### Tuning

**Read about tuning** in the [TUNNING.md file](./TUNING.MD)


#### JDK 1.7

**Solr-undertow requires JDK 1.7 or newer**.  Do not run Solr on anything older, it isn't worth the pain of inferior garbage collectors.  Oracle JDK is also prefered, Open JDK does not perform as well and at times has been incompatible.  

#### Solr WAR Files

**You can download Solr WAR files** from the Maven repository.  For example [Solr 4.10.2 WAR](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/solr/solr/4.10.2/solr-4.10.2.war) and [find older versions here](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.solr/solr).

#### Custom JVM Parameters

**To set additional Java startup parameters** for the VM, you can set the `SOLR_UNDERTOW_OPTS` environment variable before running, for example:

```sh
export SOLR_UNDERTOW_OPTS="-Xms15G -Xmx15G -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=256m"
```

And an example adding support for JMX:

```sh
export SOLR_UNDERTOW_OPTS="-Xms15G -Xmx15G -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=256m -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9901 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false"
```

#### Logging

**Logging is via Slf4j routing to _LogBack_** and can be configured differently than the [default](src/main/resources/logback.xml) by providing a [custom configuration file](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) pointed to by the system property `logback.configurationFile`. 

Solr-Undertow writes the following log files:

|filename|description|
|---|---|
|solr*.log|Java logging, including Solr internal logging|
|error*.log|Java logging, only log messages with level ERROR or above|
|access*.log|HTTP access logging, see [configuration defaults](src/main/resources/reference.conf) for more information on format| 

The default access log format is:
`%t %a %p \"%r\" %q %s %b %Dms %{o,X-Solr-QTime} ${o,X-Solr-Hits}`

In order, these are described as:

|macro|description|
|---|---|
|%t|Date and time, in Common Log Format format|
|%a|Remote IP address|
|%p|Local port|
|%U|Requested URL path|
|%q|Query string, otherwise empty string|
|%r|First line of the request|
|%s|HTTP status code of the response|
|%b|Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, or '-' or '-1' if no bytes were sent or unknown
|%D|Time taken to process the request, in millis|
|%{o,X-Solr-QTime}|Solr QTime if present in headers, Solr 4.9 and newer see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4018|
|%{o,X-Solr-Hits}|Solr Hits if present in headers, Solr 4.9 and newer see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4018|

Other available formats:

|macro|description|
|---|---|
|%A|Local IP Address|
|%B|Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers|
|%h|Remote host name|
|%h|Request protocol (also included in %r)|
|%l|Remote logical username from identd (always returns '-')|
|%m|Request method (also included in %r)|
|%u|Remote user that was authenticated|
|%v|Local server name|
|%T|Time taken to process the request, in seconds|
|%I|current Request thread name (can compare later with stacktraces)|
|%{i,xxx}|xxx is incoming headers|
|%{o,xxx}|xxx is outgoing response headers|
|%{c,xxx}|xxx is a specific cookie|
|%{r,xxx}|xxx is an attribute in the ServletRequest|
|%{s,xxx}|xxx is an attribute in the HttpSession|

You can also specify either of these prebuilt formats instead of using macros, although in Solr they may not provide as much useful information as the default format:

|format string|equivalent|
|---|---|
|common|`%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b`|
|combined|`%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{i,Referer}" "%{i,User-Agent}"`|

Building Your Own Binary
========

You may download a release under the releases here, or you can build your own binary.

`./gradlew build distTar distWithSolr`

and the resulting binaries will be under `./build/distributions` as .tgz files.  

#### Building with IntelliJ

Open the `build.gradle` file as a project, accept the default Gradle wrapper, and then fixup JDK to be 1.7 or newer.  Be sure you have Kotlin plugin installed and that it matches the version in the Gradle build, check the [gradle.properties file](./gradle.properties) for Kotlin version number.
