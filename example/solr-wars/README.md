Solr WAR files can be placed here.  You can have multiple versions and change between them using the configuration file.

The example configuration files expect a Solr distribution to be named `solr-${version}.zip` or `solr-${version}.war`, for example `solr-6.2.0.zip`.  But these can be named anything if the conf file is updated to match.
